# FolderSleuth
A small, simple program I made to collect files from several layers of folders.

The program itself is in FolderSleuth/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1
It's very straightforward. All you do is input a directory in which the program will search all folders for files.
Then you input a destination directory that all the files found will be copied to.

You can also apply filters to decide which file types you're looking for.
For example, "mp4" will find all mp4 files.
"mp4,mp3,png" will find all mp4, mp3, and png files.
Or you can just type "0" and use no filters to collect all files.
